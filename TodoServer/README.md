#### Api TODO Server
This command-line tool connects to a REST API using Go's `net/http` package. It uses more advanced concepts such as the `http.Client` and `http.Request` types to fine-tune specific
connection parameters like headers and timeouts, and the `encoding/json` package to parse JSON response data. Finally, it covers several testing techniques to test the API server as well as the command-line client application, including local tests, simulated
responses, mock servers, and integration tests.
